In the second season of AMC’s Mad Men, comedian Jimmy Barrett, played by Patrick Fischler, confronts the adman protagonist Don Draper over his sleazy affair with the comedian’s wife: “You know what I like about you? Nothing.”

```js
// Technologies.vue
watch(amount, (curr) => {
  if (curr % len == 0) {
    btnRefs.value.forEach((btn: Element) => {
      btn.classList.remove("clicked");
    });
  }
});
```
